                <p id="p2">
                    Gundam was conceived by Yoshiyuki Tomino, a visionary anime director, and made its debut with the
                    original
                    Mobile Suit
                    Gundam series. The show introduced a unique blend of real-world war themes and futuristic
                    technology,
                    setting it apart
                    from its contemporaries. This initial series marked the birth of the "Real Robot" subgenre, in
                    contrast
                    to
                    the "Super
                    Robot" genre characterized by fantastical, larger-than-life robots.
